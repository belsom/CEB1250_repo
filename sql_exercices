--What is the difference between ‘HAVING’ CLAUSE and a ‘WHERE’ CLAUSE
 HAVING clause is used to filter group in sql queries. 
 WHERE clause is used for filtering rows.
 WHERE can be use with UPDATE and DELETE but HAVING is just use with SELECT.
 HAVING should come after a GROUP BY

·Write a SQL that returns the employee name and title for all employees with even number as actual salary (to_date is 9999-01-01)

·What is wrong with the following query, re-write it making the needed corrections.

·SELECT employee.emp_no, AVG(salaries.salary)
·FROM employee INNER JOIN salaries AT employee.emp_no = salaries.emp_no
·HAVING AVG(salaries.salary) > 10000
·GROUP BY employee.emp_no

The keyword when joining 2 tables is ON and here AT is use which is wrong
HAVING clause should come after the GROUP BY

--Rewrite of the query

mysql> SELECT emp.emp_no, AVG(sal.salary) 
FROM employees emp INNER JOIN salaries sal 
ON emp.emp_no = sal.emp_no  
GROUP BY emp.emp_no 
HAVING avg(sal.salary) > 10000;
